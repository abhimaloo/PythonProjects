"""
Approach:
Use two pointers:
write to write compressed characters.
read to traverse input.
Count consecutive repeated characters.
Write the character once.
If count > 1, write the count digits.

Time Complexity:
O(n) â€” single pass through the array

ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity:
O(1) â€” in-place compression

"""
Use a sliding window approach with two pointers left and right.
Maintain the product of elements in the current window.
Expand right pointer, multiply product by nums[right]
While product >= k, move left pointer forward and divide out nums[left].
The number of new valid subarrays ending at right is (right - left + 1).
âœ… Why (right - left + 1)?
Because every subarray ending at right and starting anywhere between left and right is valid.

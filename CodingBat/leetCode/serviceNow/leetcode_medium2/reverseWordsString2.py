"""
This loop does:
Go through each character in the list.
When a space ' ' or end of list is found:
It means the current word is from start to end - 1.
It reverses the characters of that word.
Then moves start to the beginning of the next word.

Summary
Step	Description
Step 1	Reverse the whole list to reverse word order
Step 2	Reverse each word to fix its letter order
Space	O(1) (in-place)
Time	O(n) â€” each character is touched twice

"""
 Key Insight
To pair each number with an identical one, each number must appear an even number of times.
Approach
Count the frequency of each number using a hashmap (or collections.Counter).

For each number, check if its count is even.

If all counts are even â†’ return True, else False.
Time and Space Complexity
Time: O(n), where n is the number of elements in nums

Space: O(n), for storing the count in a dictionary

 Intuition
We want to know if the same number appears again within the last k indices.
This is a classic sliding window with a hash map problem.

How it Works
Iterate through the array.
Store the most recent index of each number in a dictionary.
If the same number is found again and the difference in indices â‰¤ k, return True.
Time and Space Complexity
Time: O(n)

Space: O(n)

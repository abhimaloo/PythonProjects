 Efficient Approach: Sort + Binary Search
ðŸ’¡Strategy:
Sort the products list lexicographically.
For each prefix of searchWord, use binary search (bisect_left) to find the start index of matching products.
Collect up to 3 matches starting from that index.


Time and Space Complexity:
Time:
Sorting: O(n log n)
For each character in searchWord, binary search: O(log n)
Collecting up to 3 suggestions: O(1)
So overall: O(n log n + m log n), where n = number of products, m = length of searchWord
Space:
O(n) for sorting and result

Lexicographical order is the way words are arranged in a dictionary â€” i.e., alphabetical order.
It compares words character by character, from left to right, based on the order of letters in the alphabet.
âœ… Examples:


"apple" < "banana"
Because "a" comes before "b".

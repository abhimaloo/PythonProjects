Problem Statement:
Given a string s containing only three types of characters: '(', ')', and '*',
return true if s is valid.

Rules for validity:
Every '(' must have a corresponding ')'.
Every ')' must have a corresponding '('.
'*' can be treated as '(', ')', or an empty string.
Key Idea:
Maintain two counters:
low â€” minimum possible number of open left parentheses.
high â€” maximum possible number of open left parentheses.
When we see:
'(': increase both low and high by 1 (one more open parenthesis).
')': decrease both low and high by 1 (close one parenthesis).
'*': treat '*' as either '(', ')', or empty:
So, low can decrease by 1 (if '*' is ')' or empty),
high can increase by 1 (if '*' is '(').
Ensure high never drops below 0 (can't have more ')' than '(').
At the end, if low is 0, it means valid matching.
Explanation:
low tracks the least number of open parentheses considering '*' as ')' or empty.
high tracks the most number of open parentheses considering '*' as '('.
If at any point high < 0, it means there are more ')' than '(', invalid.
At the end, if low == 0, all open parentheses can be matched.

Time Complexity:
O(n), single pass through the string.

ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity:
O(1), constant extra space

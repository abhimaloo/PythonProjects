âœ… Key Insight:
You don't need to actually perform the swaps.
Instead, count how unbalanced the string is, then compute the minimum swaps needed.
ðŸ’¡ How?
Keep a balance counter:
When you see '[': increment balance
When you see ']': decrement balance
If balance goes negative, it means you have more closing brackets than opening ones â€” i.e., imbalance.
âœ… Minimum Swaps Formula:
If max imbalance is x, then you need (x + 1) // 2 swaps.

Example Dry Run:
Input: s = "]][["
Step-by-step:
] â†’ balance = -1 â†’ max_imbalance = 1
] â†’ balance = -2 â†’ max_imbalance = 2
[ â†’ balance = -1
[ â†’ balance = 0
Max imbalance = 2 â†’ (2 + 1) // 2 = 1 swap needed âœ…

âœ… Time and Space Complexity:
Time: O(n) â€“ one pass through the string

Space: O(1) â€“ constant space

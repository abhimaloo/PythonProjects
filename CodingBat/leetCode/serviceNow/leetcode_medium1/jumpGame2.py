Explanation:
We use a greedy strategy: at every step, we try to jump as far as possible.

ðŸ“Œ Variables:
jumps: how many jumps we've made so far.

curEnd: the farthest index we can reach with the current number of jumps.

farthest: the farthest index we can reach in the next jump.


If we've reached the end of the current jump range, it's time to:
increase the jump count
update the end of the next jump range


Dry Run (nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]):
| i | nums[i] | i + nums[i] | farthest | curEnd | jumps                                      |
| - | -------- | ------------ | -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |

Done. Reached the end in 2 jumps âœ…

Time: O(n) â€” one pass through the array.

Space: O(1) â€” only variables used.

"""
There is a cycle because thereâ€™s a duplicate, 
and Floydâ€™s algorithm helps detect the cycle start, which is the duplicate number.
Time Complexity:
O(n)
ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity:
O(1) â€” Constant space
This loop detects if there's a cycle.
If a duplicate exists (and it does, by problem constraints), 
the cycle will be entered and the two pointers will eventually meet.

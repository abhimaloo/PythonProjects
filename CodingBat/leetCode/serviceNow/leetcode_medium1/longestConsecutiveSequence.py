"""
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

"""
Approach:
Key insight:
Use a set for O(1) lookups.
For each number, only try to build the sequence if it is the start of a sequence (i.e., num - 1 is not in the set).
Explanation:
Convert the list to a set to allow O(1) lookups.
Iterate through each number in the set.
If the number is the start of a sequence (num-1 not in set), start counting consecutive numbers.
Keep track of the longest streak found.
Return the longest streak at the end.

Time Complexity:
O(n) â€” Each number is checked once, and the inner while loop runs only for consecutive sequences, so overall linear time.

Space Complexity:
O(n) for the set.

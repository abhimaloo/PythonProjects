"""
Backtracking is a problem-solving technique that utilizes recursion to systematically
 explore all possible solutions to a problem by building up a solution step-by-step and abandoning 
(or backtracking from) invalid or undesirable paths as soon as they are detected
 Time and Space Complexity
Time: O(2^2n) (worst case, exponential due to recursion)

But we only build valid sequences â†’ so it's more efficient than brute force

Space: O(n) recursion depth + O(n) for stack
stack: temporary list to build one valid string
result: list of all valid combinations

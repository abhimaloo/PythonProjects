"""
Sort coins to allow early stopping when coin > amount
memo is a dictionary used for memoization (caching subproblem results)
memo[amt] will store the minimum number of coins needed for amount amt
We initialize memo[0] = 0, meaning 0 coins are needed to make amount 0.
If weâ€™ve already solved the subproblem amt, return it directly (to avoid recomputation)
Try every coin that doesnâ€™t exceed amt
diff = amt - coin is the remaining amount after choosing this coin
Recursively compute min_coins(diff)
minn keeps track of the min
Store minn in memo[amt] so we donâ€™t recompute it later
Time Complexity
Worst-case: O(amount Ã— len(coins))
Each amount from 1 to amount is computed once
Each computation checks up to len(coins) coins
ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity
O(amount) for the memoization dictionary

"""
Create a 2D list dp with m rows and n columns.

Initialize all cells with 1 because:

The first row has only 1 path (moving right only).
The first column has only 1 path (moving down only).

For every other cell (i, j), the number of ways to get there is:

Number of ways to get to the cell to the left (i, j-1), plus

Number of ways to get to the cell above (i-1, j)

This is because you can only move right or down.
Return the value at the bottom-right corner â€” total unique paths to reach the destination.

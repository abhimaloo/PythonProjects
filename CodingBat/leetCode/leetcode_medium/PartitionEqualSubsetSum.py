‚úÖ Key Insight
If total sum is odd, you can‚Äôt split it equally.
If it‚Äôs even, your goal is to find a subset whose sum is total // 2.
This becomes a subset sum problem, i.e., can you pick elements that sum to target = total // 2?
üß† Explanation:
Step 1: Early Exit
if total % 2 != 0:
    return False
Can't divide odd sum equally.

Step 2: Create DP Array
dp = [False] * (target + 1)
dp[0] = True  # sum 0 is always achievable (choose nothing)

Step 3: Update DP Table
for num in nums:
    for i in range(target, num - 1, -1):
        dp[i] = dp[i] or dp[i - num]
        
Iterate backwards to avoid overwriting values used in this round.
dp[i] = True if we can achieve sum i using some subset of numbers.

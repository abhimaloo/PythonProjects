"""
We use a sliding window of length len(p) to track character counts in s 
and compare them to p's character counts.
pCount: character frequency of p
sCount: character frequency of the current window in s
Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n)

Building and updating hash maps takes constant time per step (since the alphabet is small)

Space Complexity: O(1)

Max 26 characters in the hash maps

How It Works:
First, it checks if n is less than or equal to 0 â€” powers of 2 are always positive, so we return False for negative or 0.

Then it repeatedly divides n by 2 as long as it's divisible by 2.

If at the end, n becomes 1, it means n was a power of 2.

If not, it means there were other prime factors and n was not a pure power of 2.

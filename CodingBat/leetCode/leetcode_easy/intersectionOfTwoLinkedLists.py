How It Works:
Two pointers, l1 and l2, are initialized to the heads of the two lists.

Both pointers traverse their respective lists.

When either pointer reaches the end (None), it is redirected to the head of the other list.

Eventually, if the lists intersect, the two pointers will meet at the intersection node after at most lengthA + lengthB steps.

If they do not intersect, both pointers will eventually become None (end of both lists), and the loop will terminate.
Time: O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the two lists.

Space: O(1) â€” constant extra space.

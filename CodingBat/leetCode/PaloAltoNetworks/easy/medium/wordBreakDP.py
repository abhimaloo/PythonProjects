"""
You're given: A string s
A list of strings wordDict
Your task:
Return True if s can be segmented into space-separated words from wordDict, else return False.
âœ… Key Idea: Dynamic Programming
We use a boolean array dp where:
dp[i] is True if s[0:i] can be segmented using words from the dictionary.
ðŸ§± Intuition:
At every position i, check if there is a word in wordDict that ends at position i, 
and the substring before it is breakable.
Use Dynamic Programming to build up breakability from left to right.
Use a set for fast wordDict lookup.
Efficient and widely accepted solution.

Time	O(nÂ²) where n = len(s)
Space	O(n) for the dp array

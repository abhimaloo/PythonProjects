You are given a string s and an integer numRows.
Write the code that converts s to a zigzag pattern on numRows, and then reads the result row by row.

"""
 Zigzag Logic:
You traverse the string character by character, 
placing each character in the appropriate row. The row index moves:
downward (row++)
then upward diagonally (row--)
and repeats...

Step-by-Step Example:
Letâ€™s walk through "PAYPALISHIRING" with numRows = 3:
Initialize rows = ["", "", ""], curRow = 0, goingDown = False
For each character:
Add it to the current row
Change direction if needed (top/bottom row)
Move to the next row

After full traversal:

rows = [
  "PAHN",   # Row 0
  "APLSIIG",# Row 1
  "YIR"     # Row 2
]
Final result = "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Time Complexity:
O(n) â€” One pass through s.

ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity:
O(n) â€” Storing characters in row arrays.

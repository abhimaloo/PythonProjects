dummy is a placeholder to start building the result list.
cur is a pointer that moves along the new merged list.
Compare the heads of both lists.
Link cur.next to the smaller node.
Move that list's pointer forward.
Move cur forward.

Attach the Remaining Nodes:
At this point, one list is None.

The other list might still have nodes â€” just attach the remainder.
return dummy.next
dummy was just a starting point.
dummy.next is the real head of the merged sorted list.

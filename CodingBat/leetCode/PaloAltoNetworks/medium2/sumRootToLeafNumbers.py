Given a binary tree where each node contains a digit (0-9),
each root-to-leaf path represents a number formed by concatenating the digits along the path.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

Approach:
Use DFS (Depth First Search) to traverse the tree.
Keep track of the current number formed by the path so far.
When reaching a leaf, add the current number to the sum.
Explanation:
Start from root with current number 0.
At each node, multiply current number by 10 and add nodeâ€™s value.
When a leaf is reached, return the formed number.
Sum the values returned from left and right children recursively.
Time and Space Complexity:
Time: O(n), n = number of nodes, each visited once.
Space: O(h), h = height of the tree (recursive call stack).

This is a clean, recursive DFS implementation that efficiently computes the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers in a binary tree. 
It's optimal in both readability and performance.

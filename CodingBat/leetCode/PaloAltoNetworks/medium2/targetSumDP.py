 Approach: Dynamic Programming (Subset Sum Variation)
Key Insight:
Let P = sum of numbers assigned +

Let N = sum of numbers assigned -

We want: P - N = S
And P + N = sum(nums) â†’ total sum

Add equations: 2P = S + total_sum â†’ P = (S + total_sum) / 2

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets in nums that sum to P.

If (S + total_sum) is not even or P is negative, answer is 0.

Explanation:
dp[j] = number of ways to get sum j.

Iterate through each number and update ways for sums from target down to num.

This avoids double counting subsets.

Time Complexity:
O(n * target), where n = len(nums), target = (S + total_sum) / 2

ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity:
O(target) using 1D DP.

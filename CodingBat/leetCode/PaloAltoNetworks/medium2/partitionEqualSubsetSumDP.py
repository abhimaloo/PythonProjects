Approach: Dynamic Programming (Subset Sum Problem)
Key Insight:
The problem reduces to checking if there is a subset with sum equal to total_sum / 2.

If total sum is odd, return False immediately.

Otherwise, use a DP approach to find if such subset exists.

üîß Steps:
Calculate total_sum.

If total_sum is odd, return False.

Set target = total_sum // 2.

Use a boolean DP array to track if sums are achievable.

Iterate through numbers and update possible sums.


Explanation:
dp[0] = True means zero sum is always possible (empty subset).

For each number, update dp array to mark achievable sums.

If dp[target] is True after processing all numbers, it means there's a subset summing to target.

‚è± Time Complexity:
O(n * target), where n is length of nums and target = total_sum / 2.

üì¶ Space Complexity:
O(target) using 1D DP optimization.

"""
You are given a grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water).
Each '1' can connect to another '1' horizontally or vertically, forming an island.

üîç Your goal: Count the number of islands (groups of connected '1's).
Traverse the grid.
When you find a '1', it's a new island ‚Üí increment the count.
Then use DFS to mark all connected '1's as visited ('0').
Keep searching the rest of the grid.
Time & Space Complexity
Time: O(m * n)
Every cell is visited once at most
Space: O(m * n) (worst case recursion stack in DFS for large islands)

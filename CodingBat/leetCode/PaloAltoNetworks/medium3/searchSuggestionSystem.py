"""
Given an array of strings products and a string searchWord, design a system that suggests at most three product names from products after each character of searchWord is typed.

Suggested products should have a prefix matching the currently typed characters.

If more than three products match, return the three lexicographically smallest.

Return a list of lists of the suggested products after each character is typed.



Approach: Sort + Binary Search
Key Idea:
Sort the products lexicographically.

For each prefix of searchWord, use binary search to find the starting index of products matching the prefix.

Collect up to 3 products starting from that index with the matching prefix.

Return the list of suggestions per prefix.



Explanation:
Sorting ensures suggestions are lexicographically ordered.

Binary search (bisect_left) quickly finds the first product that could match the prefix.

Collect up to 3 products starting from that index.

Repeat for each prefix of searchWord.

‚è± Time Complexity:
Sorting: O(n log n), where n = number of products.

For each prefix (m prefixes), binary search O(log n) + up to 3 checks ‚Üí O(m log n).

Overall: O(n log n + m log n)

üì¶ Space Complexity:
O(n) for sorting and output.

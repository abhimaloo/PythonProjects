"""
Approach: BFS or DFS with Rolling Logic
Use BFS or DFS to explore the maze.

From the current position, roll the ball in all four directions until hitting a wall.

Add the stopping position to the queue or recursion if not visited.

Repeat until reaching the destination or running out of options.
Time Complexity:
O(m * n), since each cell is visited at most once.

ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity:
O(m * n) for the visited array and queue.

"""
Approach:
Since the list is in forward order, we can do either:
Reverse the list, double it like in normal addition with carry, then reverse it back.
Or, recursive approach to process from left to right with carry passing backward.
âœ… Step-by-step (Reverse approach):
Reverse the linked list.
Double each digit with carry.
Reverse back the result.
